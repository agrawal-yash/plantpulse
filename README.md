# PlantPulse: AI Plant Disease Detection System

An AI-powered application that detects diseases in plant leaves through image analysis and provides detailed treatment recommendations.

## üåø Overview

PlantPulse is an AI-powered web application that helps gardeners, farmers, and plant enthusiasts identify diseases in their plants through image analysis. Simply upload a clear image of a plant leaf, and our system will analyze it to detect potential diseases, providing detailed information and treatment recommendations.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Health Assessment**: Determine if your plant is healthy or diseased with confidence ratings
- **Disease Information**: Get detailed information about detected diseases:
  - Comprehensive descriptions
  - Probable causes
  - Recommended remedies
  - Prevention strategies
- **Report Generation**: Download detailed analysis reports as HTML files
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Dark/Light Theme**: Toggle between viewing modes for comfort
- **Multiple Interfaces**: Available as both a Flask web application and Streamlit app

## üîç Supported Plants & Diseases

The system can detect 38 different combinations of plants and disease conditions including:

- Apple (Scab, Black Rot, Cedar Rust, Healthy)

- Corn (Gray Leaf Spot, Common Rust, Northern Leaf Blight, Healthy)
- Grape (Black Rot, Esca/Black Measles, Leaf Blight/Isariopsis Leaf Spot, Healthy)
- Orange (Haunglongbing/Citrus Greening)
- Peach (Bacterial Spot, Healthy)
- Pepper Bell (Bacterial Spot, Healthy)
- Potato (Early Blight, Late Blight, Healthy)
- Raspberry (Healthy)
- Soybean (Healthy)

## üß† AI Model Architecture & Algorithms

Our plant disease detection system employs a comprehensive pipeline of image processing and deep learning techniques:

### Image Preprocessing
- **Gabor Filters**: Extract texture features by analyzing different orientations and frequencies in leaf images, highlighting disease-specific patterns
- **Color Space Transformations**: Converts RGB to HSV color spaces to isolate disease characteristics
- **Image Normalization**: Standardizes pixel values to ensure consistent model inputs

### Feature Extraction & Classification
- **Vision Transformer (ViT)**: State-of-the-art architecture that treats images as sequences of patches for superior pattern recognition
- **Transfer Learning**: Leverages pre-trained models fine-tuned on our plant disease dataset
- **Attention Mechanisms**: Focuses the model on disease-relevant areas of the leaf

### Model Training & Optimization
- **Model Checkpointing**: Saves optimal model states

## üõ† Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **AI/ML**: PyTorch, TorchVision, Transformers (Hugging Face)
- **Image Processing**: OpenCV, scikit-image
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **APIs**: Google Gemini AI API for detailed disease information
